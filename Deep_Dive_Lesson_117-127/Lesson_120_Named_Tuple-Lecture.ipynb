    "We have seen how we interpreted tuples as data structures \n",
    "\n",
    "The position fo the obecjt contained in the tuple gave it meaning \n",
    "For example, we can represent a 2D coordinate as (10,20)\n",
    "\n",
    "If pt is a position tuple, we can retrieve the x and y coordinates using:  x, y = pt or x = pt[0] y = pt[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, to calculate the distance of pt from the origin we could write \n",
    "\n",
    "But that tuple is not very readable, and if someone sees this they need to know what is x, y coordinates \n",
