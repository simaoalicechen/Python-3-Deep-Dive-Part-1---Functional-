    "When an object is assigned to a variable a = 10 \n",
    "That variable points to some obecjt \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "That object can be accessed usingtaht name in various parts of our code \n",
    "\n",
    "But not just pointing to anywhere!! \n",
    "\n",
    "That variable name and it's binding (name and object) only 'exists' in specific parts of our code. \n",
    "The portion of code where that name/biding is defiend, is called the lexical scope of the variable. \n",

    "The Global Scope \n",
    "\n",
    "The global scope is essentially the module scope. \n",
    "It spans a single file one. \n",
    "There is no concept of a truly global(across all the modules in our entries app) scope in Python. \n",
    "The only exception to this are some of the built-in globally available objects, such as: \n",
    "True, False, None, dict, print \n",
    "The built in and global avriables can be used anywhere inside our module ---> Including inside any function  \n",
    "\n",
    "Global scopes are nested inside the built-in scope \n",
    "\n",

    "If you reference a variable name inside a scope and Python deos not find it in that scope's namespace \n",
    "\n",
    "If Python doesn't find a value in your directed scope and then it would go to the larger module or built in scope. \n",
    "It always starts with the current scope. \n",
    "It will look for it in an enclosing scope's namespace \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples \n",
    "module1.py     Python does not find True or print in the current (module/global) scope\n",
    "print(True)    So, it looks for them in teh enclosing scope ---> built-in \n",

    "Module2.py     Python does not find a or print in the current(module/global) scope \n",

    "\n",
    "Variables defined inisde a function are not created until the function is called \n",
    "Every time the function is called, a new scope is created \n",
    "Variables defined inside the function are assigned tothat scope ---> Function local scope \n",
    "                                                                ---> Local scope \n",

    "The actual object the variable references could be different each time the function is called \n",
    "(This is why recursion works!) \n",

    "Nested Scope \n",
    "Scopes are often nested \n",
    "Built-in Scope includes Module Scope \n",
    "Python looks for a method in Module Scope first; if nothing there, then it goes to Module Scope. If not there, it \n",
    "returns a run-time error. In each Module Scope, there are different functions, aka local scopes, and they create more methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Namespace lookups: \n",
    "When requesting the object bound to a variable name: \n",
    "e.g. print(a) \n",
    "Python will try to find the object bound to the variabe: \n",
    "1. in current local scope first \n",
    "2. works up the chain of enclosing scopes \n",

    "\n",
